- 👋 Hi, I’m Alex Chapman, a 22 year old blind guy who loves technology among other things and am trying to get into development.
- 👀 I’m interested in different types of technology, making different programs and things both with and without the use of AI, and also watching and creating content for YouTube such as funny Windows error videos and Logo bloopers.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python, with the help of AI tools here and there.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
